    <h1>This is a character counter</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple character counter. You will enter any text in the field
      below, and you will automatically see how many characters have been used.
      It can be a word, a text, a paragraph or as much as necessary. Feel free.
    </p>

    <textarea name="anyText" id="anyText" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>

    <p>
      The number of characters used is <span id="numberOfCharacters"></span>
    </p>

    <p>Note: line breaks also count as one character</p>
